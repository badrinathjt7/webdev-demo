# 📖 About This Project

This repository is a structured **educational teaching product** designed to explain modern web development from first principles.

It combines:

- A guided instructional framework (WHY → WHAT → HOW → REAL-LIFE)
- A live interactive demo
- Editable browser-based code playgrounds
- Architecture visualization
- Real-world product mapping

Originally developed for a 30-minute educational session (GMeet format), it is now structured as a reusable learning resource.

# 🧠 Learning Structure

This framework teaches web development in layers:

0️⃣ Design Foundations  
1️⃣ HTML — Structure  
2️⃣ CSS — Styling Systems  
3️⃣ JavaScript — Interactivity  
4️⃣ React — Component Architecture  
5️⃣ Full Stack — Data Flow & APIs  

Each section builds on the previous one.
